# InfoVisCoReMA
The website focuses on visualisations in two areas:
transcription data and semantic annotation data created during the CoReMA project (Cooking Recipes of the Middle Ages, http://gams.uni-graz.at/context:corema).

The files were created during the class "Webentwicklung" at the University of Graz, whose main purpose was an introduction to Web technologies. Therefore, all html-files not containing visualisations should be taken with a grain of salt as they function to introduce the student to basic concepts and techniques.
Relevant for information visualisation purposes are the following files:
- transcr.html
- gr1.html
- sem_anno-html
